Spectrum
========

A game developed in **C#** using the **XNA Framework** at the Global Game Jam 2012 in LIT Thurles, Co. Tipperary. This game  stayed in development even after the Game Jam, We then presented it at Gamesfleadh 2012 in LIT Thurles again a few weeks later. The game was then played by the general public and people from the gaming industry and overall it got a great reception.
